# Realtime Chat App | React, GraphQL & Websockets

## About

This is me following Jack Herrington's [youtube video](https://youtu.be/E3NHd-PkLrQ)

Year 2021

## Resources

- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)

## CLI

Used this npx tool to start off with client

```jsx
npx degit https://github.com/jherr/wp5-starter-react.git\#main
```

## What I learned

- Graphql Subscriptions & websockets are awesome! Just awesome! They allow to build amazing apps like live chats with instant response time & no delays and low load on the network

- I'm in love with webpack5 ModuleFederation. It allows to share react components between different apps. Damn üòç
